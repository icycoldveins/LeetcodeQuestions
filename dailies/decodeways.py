""" Let's walk through the solution using the example input string `s = "226"`. Remember, the goal is to find the total number of ways to decode this string given the mapping ('1' -> 'A', '2' -> 'B', ..., '26' -> 'Z').

### Step 1: Handle Edge Cases

- The string is "226", which is neither empty nor starts with '0', so it doesn't return 0 here. It proceeds to the main algorithm.

### Step 2: Initialize the DP Array

- Initialize `dp` to `[0] * (len("226") + 1) = [0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- Set `dp[0] = 1` (one way to decode an empty string) and `dp[1] = 1` (since '2' is a valid single-character decoding).

Now, `dp` looks like `[1, 1, 0, 0]`.

### Step 3: Loop Through the String

The loop starts at 2 and goes up to the length of the string `len(s) + 1`.

#### i = 2:

- Character at `i-1` is '2' (`s[1]`).
- **Single Digit Check (`s[i - 1] != '0')`**:
    - '2' is not '0', so we add `dp[i - 1]` to `dp[i]`. Before this, both are 1. So, `dp[2]` becomes 1 + 1 = 2.
- **Two Digit Check (`10 <= two_digit <= 26)`**:
    - The two digits are "22" (from `s[0:2]`). It's within 10 and 26. So, add `dp[i - 2]` to `dp[i]`. Now, `dp[2]` becomes 2 + 1 = 3.

Now, `dp` looks like `[1, 1, 3, 0]`.

#### i = 3:

- Character at `i-1` is '6' (`s[2]`).
- **Single Digit Check**:
    - '6' is not '0', so we add `dp[2]` to `dp[3]`. Initially, `dp[3]` is 0. So, `dp[3]` becomes 0 + 3 = 3.
- **Two Digit Check**:
    - The two digits are "26" (from `s[1:3]`). It's within 10 and 26. So, add `dp[i - 2]` to `dp[i]`. Now, `dp[3]` becomes 3 + 1 = 4.

Now, `dp` looks like `[1, 1, 3, 4]`.

### Step 4: Return the Result

- The loop has finished, and now you look at `dp[len(s)]` which is `dp[3]` for "226". This is 4.
- The function returns 4, indicating there are 4 ways to decode "226".

### Conclusion for "226"

- The string "226" can be decoded as:
    1. "B" "B" "F" - "2" "2" "6"
    2. "B" "Z" - "2" "26"
    3. "VF" - "22" "6"
- The dynamic programming solution correctly identifies that there are 3 ways to decode it. """
